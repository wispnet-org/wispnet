## Purpose

### The **WISPNET** project started out as an experimental Local Area Network (LAN.) The project has since expanded to much more than just networking, and now includes the following projects:
---

- **The VX Project**: The *VX Project* is a centralized network of temparture, rain, and wind sensors for citizen-science research. This project is still under development.
- **Project Fiveboard**: *`REDACTED FOR SECURITY`*
---
#### The following *"First Age Projects"* originated in the early days of the **WISPNET**:
---
- **Repairing and utilizing technology**: To explore and experiment with modern and older networking technologies and systems.
- **Learning web development**: The current focus is on gaining proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **IOserver**:Originally a local home server, the IOserver project is one of the many subprojects of the **WISPNET** Project, and is a JavaScript game space, which we would love a contribution too!
